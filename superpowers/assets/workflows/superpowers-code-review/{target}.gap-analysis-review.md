Run the Superpowers gap-analysis review lane.

Use the installed verification guidance to check whether the implementation
actually satisfies the approved requirements, plan, decomposition, and claimed
test evidence. Flag missing behavior, unverified acceptance criteria, drift from
the plan, and test claims that were not proven by commands or artifacts.

Write concrete findings that the feedback-processing lane can resolve in one
pass with file, artifact, command, or requirement references.

Read the code-review context from workflow root metadata
`gc.build.code_review_context_path`. Write the gap-analysis report to workflow
root metadata path `gc.build.gap_analysis_report_path`, which should be
`<artifact_root>/gap-analysis-report.md`.

The gap-analysis report is a Markdown build artifact, not a freeform note. It
must be valid for `gc.build.review.v1`: start with YAML front matter, then
include the required Markdown sections `## Verdict`, `## Findings`, and
`## Verification`. Use `status: approved` when closing with
`code_review.gap_verdict=approve`; use `status: changes_required` when closing
with `code_review.gap_verdict=iterate`.

The front matter must include this shape:

```yaml
---
schema: gc.build.review.v1
workflow:
  id: <workflow-root-id>
  formula: <workflow-formula>
methodology:
  pack: superpowers
  name: superpowers-code-review
producer:
  formula: superpowers-code-review
  stage: gap-analysis-review
  attempt: <positive integer>
status: approved
trace:
  upstream:
    - path: <review-context-or-implementation-review-path>
      hash: sha256:<digest>
      ids: [SEC-001]
  coverage:
    - id: SEC-001
      status: covered
---
```

If an upstream entry lists `ids`, every id must appear exactly once in
`trace.coverage` and in a Markdown coverage table. The validator only
recognizes a Markdown table with an `ID` column and a `Status` column. Use this
shape and make the ID/status pairs exactly match `trace.coverage`:

| ID | Status |
| --- | --- |
| SEC-001 | covered |

Coverage statuses are not finding statuses or verdict statuses. Use only schema
allowed coverage statuses: `covered`, `blocked`, `deferred`, `not_applicable`,
`out_of_scope`, or `superseded`. For `status: changes_required`, use
`blocked` for the coverage rows that are not yet satisfied, and include
`rationale: <why this id is blocked>` on every non-`covered` coverage row. Do
not use `violated`, `resolved`, `approved`, or `changes_required` as
`trace.coverage[].status` or Markdown coverage table statuses. The Markdown
coverage table remains ID/status only; the rationale belongs in YAML front
matter.

Close with `gc.outcome=pass`, `code_review.gap_verdict=approve|iterate`,
`code_review.gap_report_path=<gap-analysis report path>`, and
`code_review.output_path=<gap-analysis report path>`.

Use the exact claimed bead id when updating metadata. Do not pass freeform notes
or additional positional arguments to `gc bd update`; unquoted words can resolve to
unrelated beads. Use this command shape:

```bash
gc bd update "$CLAIMED_BEAD_ID" \
  --set-metadata 'gc.outcome=pass' \
  --set-metadata 'code_review.gap_verdict=approve' \
  --set-metadata 'code_review.gap_report_path=<gap-analysis report path>' \
  --set-metadata 'code_review.output_path=<gap-analysis report path>'
gc bd close "$CLAIMED_BEAD_ID" --reason 'Gap-analysis review approved with no required findings.'
```

Do not set `code_review.verdict` or `code_review.report_path`; the
process-code-review lane owns those approval-check fields.

Do not invoke provider-native subagents or upstream plugin runtime commands.
