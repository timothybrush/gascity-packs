Write the Superpowers requirements spec from the approved design.

This lane maps stock Superpowers checklist items 6-7: write the durable design
doc/spec, then run the inline Spec self-review before any user/spec approval
gate can pass.

Resolve the approved design candidate from workflow root metadata. Convert that
design into the normalized requirements artifact consumed by build-base. Include
the requested outcome, constraints, non-goals, accepted design, acceptance
criteria, testing expectations, risks, and any remaining questions.

The approved design candidate is the Gas City artifact for the stock design-doc state.
If the run can safely mirror that document into the target repository, use the
stock `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` location; otherwise
keep it under the workflow artifact root and record the artifact path for
traceability.

On repeated attempts, read the current requirements/spec artifact and the latest
feedback application summary before writing. Preserve previously accepted
review fixes and explicit user edits; update the artifact from the approved
design without clobbering loop feedback.

Run the stock Spec self-review before closing:

- Placeholder scan: remove `TBD`, `TODO`, incomplete sections, and vague
  requirements.
- Internal consistency: resolve contradictions between sections.
- Scope check: keep the spec focused enough for one implementation plan.
- Ambiguity check: make any two-way interpretation explicit.

Write or update the normalized requirements artifact path from workflow root
metadata. If the target repo can safely mirror a design doc under
`docs/superpowers/specs/`, record that mirror path in the artifact, but do not
commit from this lane unless the routed bead explicitly asks for it.

Before closing, update the exact claimed bead id with the lane metadata:

```bash
gc bd update "$CLAIMED_BEAD_ID" \
  --set-metadata 'gc.outcome=pass' \
  --set-metadata 'design_review.output_path=<requirements artifact path>' \
  --set-metadata 'design_review.self_review_passed=true'
gc bd close "$CLAIMED_BEAD_ID" --reason 'Superpowers requirements spec written and self-reviewed.'
```

Do not pass `--metadata` or `--set-metadata` to `gc bd close`. Do not set
`design_review.verdict`; the approval lane owns the loop verdict.

Do not invoke provider-native subagents or upstream plugin runtime commands.
This Gas City lane owns the written spec pass.
