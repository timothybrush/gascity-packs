Apply build-basic starter review findings.

Use implementation target {{implementation_target}} for any code changes. Read
the starter review synthesis. If all three review lanes approve, write a no-op
review summary. If required fixes or missing evidence remain, make the smallest
focused changes, run the relevant proof commands, and write the review-fix
summary under the build artifact root.

Apply fixes to the implementation source anchor/worktree named in the review
context, not to the launcher rig root. An unchanged root checkout is not itself
a required fix for build-basic; publish owns propagation beyond the source
anchor. If the only reported issue is "implementation exists in the worktree but
not the root checkout" and the source anchor/worktree passes the requirements,
record a no-op fix summary and set `code_review.verdict=done`.

Set `code_review.verdict=done` only when acceptance, test evidence, and
simplicity all approve after this pass. Set `code_review.verdict=iterate` when
required fixes remain.

Always close with `gc.outcome=pass`,
`code_review.verdict=done|iterate`,
`code_review.report_path=<starter review summary path>`, and
`code_review.output_path=<starter review summary path>`.

Use the exact claimed bead id when updating metadata. Do not pass freeform notes
or additional positional arguments to `gc bd update`; unquoted words can resolve to
unrelated beads. Use this command shape:

```bash
gc bd update "$CLAIMED_BEAD_ID" \
  --set-metadata 'gc.outcome=pass' \
  --set-metadata 'code_review.verdict=done' \
  --set-metadata 'code_review.report_path=<starter review summary path>' \
  --set-metadata 'code_review.output_path=<starter review summary path>'
gc bd close "$CLAIMED_BEAD_ID" --reason 'Build-basic starter review approved.'
```

Do not invoke provider-native subagents. This starter factory graph lane is the
fix delegation mechanism.
