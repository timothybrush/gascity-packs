This is the `implementation-base` methodology contract implementation step.

Concrete methodology packs override this step to apply their native
implementation discipline. Work only inside the prepared worktree and preserve
the source anchor for the close step.

Default fallback behavior must still enforce the worktree contract: resolve the
source anchor from workflow metadata, read `work_dir` from that source anchor,
and `cd "$WORKTREE"` before source reads, edits, tests, hashes, or commits.
`gc.work_dir` is the launcher rig root, not the implementation worktree. When
reading beads with `gc bd show --json`, handle both an object and a one-element
list before reading metadata.

Write the per-item implementation summary as a `gc.build.implementation-summary.v1`
artifact and record its absolute path on the workflow root bead as
`gc.implementation.summary_path` before closing.

The summary body must contain these exact schema-required `##` headings in this
order:

- `## Summary`
- `## Intended Behavior`
- `## Changed Files`
- `## Verification`
- `## Remaining Risks`

Artifact validation: this step is gated by `.gc/scripts/checks/build-artifact-valid.sh`, which validates the summary recorded at `gc.implementation.summary_path` (fallbacks `gc.build.implementation_summary_path`, then `gc.var.summary_path`) against schema `gc.build.implementation-summary.v1`. Before closing this step, read the launcher rig root from the workflow root bead's `gc.work_dir`, then run the same validator locally from that rig root with `GC_BEAD_ID=<claimed-step-id> .gc/scripts/checks/build-artifact-valid.sh`; fix every reported validation error before setting `gc.outcome=pass`. On repair attempts (`gc.attempt` greater than 1), read the validator errors from `gc.attempt_log` on the validation loop control bead (the dependent of this step bead) and repair the summary in place instead of rewriting it. Two bounded repair attempts follow the first failure; exhausting them closes this stage with `gc.outcome=fail` and machine-readable validation errors that block downstream stages. Never ask questions in headless mode; record unresolved ambiguity inside the summary.
