Resolve `<source-anchor-id>` using the same rules as `prepare-worktree`. Read `work_dir` from the source anchor and verify the implementation commit and
summary evidence are present in that worktree. Write per-item summary to
{{summary_path}} when set.

On success, close only `<source-anchor-id>` with `gc.outcome=pass`. Read the
source anchor back with `bd show <source-anchor-id> --json` and verify
`status=closed` and `gc.outcome=pass`; if either check fails, fix the source
anchor before closing this step. Then close this step. Do not close the
drain-unit convoy, parent convoy, or broader workflow root from this step.
