# Changelog

All notable changes to slack-full (formerly slack-pack) are documented in
this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Renamed the pack directory from `slack-pack/` to `slack-full/` and the
  `pack.toml` name from `slack` to `slack-full` as part of the Slack pack
  tiering split (`gc-yrw`). This pack is now **Tier 3** of the Slack
  family; the smaller [slack-mini](../slack-mini) (Tier 1) and
  [slack-channel](../slack-channel) (Tier 2) packs were extracted from it.
  The user-facing verb surface (`gc slack <cmd>`) and the registered
  `slack` service name are unchanged — only the catalog directory and pack
  name moved, so there is no collision with `slack-mini` / `slack-channel`.
  See the [tiering design memo](../docs/design/slack-pack-tiering.md) and
  the README "Tiering" section for the decision tree. (`gc-yrw.5`)
- Moved CLI commands (`gc slack import-app`, `map-channel`, `map-rig`,
  `sync-commands`, `enable-room-launch`, `post-message`) from the gc
  binary into a new in-pack Go module at `examples/slack-pack/cli/`
  (module `github.com/sjarmak/gc-slack-cli`). User-facing surface
  (`gc slack <cmd>`) is unchanged — pack wrappers under
  `commands/<cmd>.sh` exec the new binary at
  `$GC_PACK_DIR/cli/gc-slack-cli` so operator command-line ergonomics
  stay identical to the pre-relocation gc-binary verbs. The pack now
  ships two Go binaries (adapter + cli), each in its own go.mod;
  `gc slack status` continues to dispatch to the existing Python
  implementation under `scripts/slack_chat_status.py`. Build flow
  documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#build-flow).
  (`gc-coe10`)

### Added

- `gc slack retry-peer-fanout` — operational recovery for peer-fanout.
  Walks recent `extmsg.peer_fanout_failed` events (added in this change
  too), filters by `--since` / `--conversation` / `--max`, deduplicates
  against successful `extmsg.peer_fanout_retried` events, and re-issues
  each notification via the new
  `POST /v0/city/<cityName>/extmsg/peer-fanout/retry` endpoint with a
  small cooldown between attempts. The endpoint emits an
  `extmsg.peer_fanout_retried` audit event per attempt with the
  `original_seq`, so re-running on the same set is a no-op
  (`gc-cby.7`).
- SIGHUP-driven reload for the four CLI-written registry files
  (`apps.json`, `channel_mappings.json`, `rig_mappings.json`,
  `room_launch_mappings.json`). Operators can now run
  `gc slack import-app`, `gc slack map-channel`, `gc slack map-rig`, or
  `gc slack enable-room-launch` and signal the adapter with
  `pkill -HUP gc-slack-adapter` (or any other SIGHUP delivery) to pick
  up the new bindings without a service restart (`gc-cby.23`). Reload is
  all-or-nothing across the four registries — a single parse failure
  aborts the cycle with the live state untouched. A missing file is a
  no-op (preserves state); operators clear by writing an empty `{}`
  document, NOT by `rm`.

### Changed

- The trailing reminder printed by `gc slack map-rig`,
  `gc slack map-channel`, and `gc slack enable-room-launch` now leads
  with the SIGHUP path (`pkill -HUP gc-slack-adapter`) and offers
  `gc service restart slack` as the fallback, since SIGHUP avoids the
  startup gap.
- Adapter Go source relocated from `examples/oversight-rig/adapter/`
  to `examples/slack-pack/adapter/` (`gc-28a`). The pack is now
  self-contained for upstream extraction into a separate
  `gascity-packs` repo. No behavioral change; the binary path
  (`examples/slack-pack/adapter/gc-slack-adapter`) is unchanged, so
  the supervised `proxy_process` service picks up the new build at
  next restart with byte-identical functionality.
- Build flow simplified to a single command:
  `cd examples/slack-pack/adapter && go build -o gc-slack-adapter`.

### Security

- Default adapter state under `/tmp/gc-slack-adapter/*` is no longer
  world-readable on shared hosts (`gc-ywe.6`). Concretely: the
  identity registry, handle-alias registry, and inbound file store now
  create directories with mode `0o700` and files with mode `0o600`
  (previously `0o755`/`0o644`). Pre-fix installs are migrated on
  startup by a one-shot tightener that walks the three configured
  store paths and chmods only-if-strictly-looser; setuid, setgid, and
  sticky bits are preserved so operator-customized layouts (e.g.
  setgid for shared-group access) survive intact. Operators who
  deliberately set tighter perms (e.g. `0o400` read-only) are also
  left alone. As defense-in-depth, the proxy_process Unix domain
  socket is chmod'd to `0o600` after bind on top of its
  `0o700` controller-managed parent directory at
  `/tmp/gcsvc-<uid>/<hash>/`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-03

Initial preview. Feature-by-feature port of the upstream `discord` pack
shape; today's surface is enough to run a multi-session oversight loop
end-to-end (DMs, rooms, peer fanout, identity overrides, bidirectional
file attachments).

### Added

- `gc slack bind-dm` — bind a Slack DM channel to one named session.
- `gc slack bind-room` — bind a room to multiple sessions, with
  `--enable-peer-fanout`, `--allow-untargeted-publication`,
  `--max-peer-triggered-publishes`, `--max-total-peer-deliveries`,
  `--default-handle`, `--handle HANDLE=SESSION`, and
  `--binding-owner`.
- `gc slack reply-current` — reply to the latest Slack event in the
  current session, routed through gc's `/extmsg/outbound` so transcript
  recording and peer fanout fire (`--via adapter` keeps the direct path
  for diagnostics).
- `gc slack publish` — publish to a session's saved binding (target
  session required, no event-scan fallback).
- `gc slack publish-to-channel` — publish to an arbitrary channel ID
  with no session binding required.
- `gc slack status` — read-only diagnostics over adapters, bindings,
  and recent traffic. Supports `--session SID`, `--since`, and
  `--json`.
- `gc slack react` — add an emoji reaction to a Slack message.
- `gc slack identity` — register and unregister per-session
  `chat:write.customize` identities so each bound session posts under
  its own persona.
- `gc slack handle-alias` — register and unregister cross-channel
  `@handle` to session-id aliases used by the address-by-handle
  protocol.
- `gc slack upload` — bidirectional file attachments
  (`/publish-file` outbound, auto-download of inbound files into
  `$INBOUND_FILE_STORE/<channel>/<ts>-<filename>`, scrubbed by an
  in-process retention janitor).
- `template-fragments/slack-v0.template.md` — composable prompt
  fragment for any agent in a slack-bound session.
- Pack-owned intake service (`[[service]]` proxy_process) supervising
  the adapter via UDS for `/publish`, with the public Slack webhook
  still terminating at adapter TCP `:8775`.
- Native `SessionID` field on `PublishRequest` (replacing the prior
  metadata workaround).
- Scope banner and host-agnostic README copy for upstream-prep
  readiness.
- Adapter env contract documented in the package docstring and in the
  pack README, categorized as must-set / optional-override /
  controller-injected / consumer-specific.

### Changed

- **Breaking (standalone deployments only):** `GC_CITY_NAME` is now
  required. The adapter previously fell back to a hardcoded city name
  when the env var was unset, silently routing inbound traffic to the
  wrong destination. Any standalone (`run.sh`-style) deployment must
  set `GC_CITY_NAME` explicitly. `proxy_process`-supervised deployments
  are unaffected as long as the env file sourced before `gc start`
  defines it.

### Provenance

This release was developed in-tree at `examples/slack-pack/` (with the
adapter at `examples/oversight-rig/adapter/`). Key gascity commits:

- `cfd6d7de` — initial Slack extmsg adapter (Path B).
- `8495e4d7` — pack scaffold + `bind-dm` + `reply-current`.
- `4aa07108` — `bind-room` with peer-fanout policy plumbing.
- `39d92543` — route `reply-current` through `gc /extmsg/outbound`.
- `c1e1f6a1` — adapter UDS mode + `[[service]]` proxy_process
  (`gc-5rz` Phase A).
- `111641dd` — `gc slack status` read-only diagnostics.
- `3edeb3d0` — `gc slack publish` to session bindings.
- `b8abb72d` — identity DELETE + bidirectional file attachments + new
  commands.
- `bfd64511` — native `SessionID` in `PublishRequest`, drop metadata
  workaround (`gc-kvt`).
- `010bc588` — strip host-specific references and add scope banner
  (`gc-ywe.1`, `gc-ywe.4`).
- `3db27544` — document adapter env contract and remove the
  `ds-research` `GC_CITY_NAME` fallback (`gc-ywe.2`).
