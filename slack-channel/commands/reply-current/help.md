Reply into the conversation of the latest inbound message delivered to this
session.

The adapter remembers, per session, the last Slack message it bridged in.
`reply-current` posts back into that same channel — the natural "answer the
thing that just pinged me" verb. With `--thread-current` it threads the
reply under that message; with `--reply-to <ts>` it threads under a specific
ts; with neither it posts unthreaded into the channel.

If the adapter has seen no inbound for this session (e.g. just restarted),
it falls back to the session's single channel binding. If there is neither a
recent inbound nor a single binding, use `publish-to-channel`.

Usage:
  gc slack-channel reply-current [--session <id>]
                                 (--body <text> | --body-file <path>)
                                 [--thread-current | --reply-to <ts>]

Flags:
  --session         Override the session id (default: $GC_SESSION_ID).
  --body            Message text. Mutually exclusive with --body-file.
  --body-file       Read the message body from a file.
  --thread-current  Thread under the latest inbound message. Mutually
                    exclusive with --reply-to.
  --reply-to        Slack message ts to thread under.

Examples:
  gc slack-channel reply-current --body "on it" --thread-current
  gc slack-channel reply-current --body "see PR #42"

On success, prints the adapter's JSON receipt {"ok":true,"ts":...}.

Requires: GC_CITY_NAME + GC_API_BASE_URL, plus `jq` and `curl` on PATH. The
slack-channel service must be running.
